# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

This is a Burp Suite Extension template project using the Montoya API (currently a minimal starter project).

## Architecture

- **Main Entry Point**: `src/main/java/Extension.java` - implements `BurpExtension` interface
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL, Java 21 compatibility
- **Dependencies**: Montoya API 2025.10 (compile-only), no runtime dependencies
- **Extension Pattern**: Single-class extension that initializes through `initialize(MontoyaApi montoyaApi)` method

## Key Development Commands

```bash
./gradlew build    # Build and test the extension
./gradlew jar      # Create the extension JAR file
./gradlew clean    # Clean build artifacts
```

The built JAR file will be in `build/libs/` and can be loaded directly into Burp Suite.

## Extension Loading in Burp

1. Build the JAR using `./gradlew jar`
2. In Burp: Extensions > Installed > Add > Select the JAR file
3. For quick reloading during development: Ctrl/⌘ + click the Loaded checkbox

## Documentation Structure

- See @docs/bapp-store-requirements.md for BApp Store submission requirements
- See @docs/montoya-api-examples.md for code patterns and extension structure  
- See @docs/development-best-practices.md for development guidelines
- See @docs/resources.md for external documentation and links

## Current State

This is a template project with minimal functionality. The main extension class currently only sets the extension name to "My Extension" and contains a TODO for actual implementation.
